Descriptions/ Design of Game
There are two input methods that we used: keyboard and iTracker. This game can be played solo or with a partner. It is a Phaser 3 based game. The accessible feature can make the game playing with anyone who is able to tilt their heads a little. You can really make the rules with your friends. Either the player who finishes first wins or simply the player who gains more weight within a period of time. Enjoy!

System Requirement:
If you run on local, please install server on your computer. We use MAMMP.
Make sure you have Python 3.X installed.
If you want to test the iTracker mode fully, please have the software installed, otherwise you can just play with your mouse.

Instructions:
Place the downloaded file in the root directory of the server.
Make sure the server is running.
Then you can play with our accessible game!
